<b>Assignment<b> ->Make An Angular application to perform CRUD operations, with an emphasis on component reusability. Specifically, the application should incorporate a single component for both the addition and editing of data, and should rely solely on local storage. The component should include fields for name, phone number, and email address, each with appropriate validation measures. Upon deletion of data, an alert should be displayed. Additionally, the application should feature a table with sorting and pagination capabilities.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
